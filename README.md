# Sonic The Hedgehog 1 for Sega Master System editor by WV, extended by Maxim

This is a ROM editor that lets you edit various aspects of the game.

Currently editable:

- Level layout
- Tilesets (load and save images and edit in an image editor)
- Object positions and types
- Level flags
- Level blocks (32x32 blocks making up the levels)
- Level names

Still to come (in no particular order):

- Lots more UI improvements to make editing easier
- Fully removing size restrictions (currently sticking to the original game's data arenas)
- Music/SFX editing/replacement
- Palette editing (base palette and cycles)
- Static screen editing
- Adding a level select, sound test, game saves?
- Ability to add any number of levels, tilesets, etc
- Sonic 1 GG support
